    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>0.5cup butter</li>
        <li>5 Granny Smith apples -- peeled, cored, quartered, and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 (9 inch) refrigerated prerolled pie crusts</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Place 1/2 cup butter into a heavy cast iron skillet, and melt butter in the oven. Remove skillet and sprinkle with brown sugar; return to oven to heat while you prepare the apples.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Remove skillet, and place 1 refrigerated pie crust on top of the brown sugar. Top the pie crust with half the sliced apples. Sprinkle apples with 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon; place a second pie crust over the apples; top the second crust with the remaining apples, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Top with the third crust; sprinkle the top crust with 1/4 cup sugar, and dot with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cut 4 slits into the top crust for steam.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Serve warm.</p>
